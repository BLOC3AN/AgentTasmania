# Silero VAD Integration

## Overview

This project has been enhanced with **Silero VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to provide more accurate and intelligent voice detection capabilities. Silero VAD is an enterprise-grade, pre-trained AI model that offers superior performance compared to traditional RMS-based detection methods.

## Features

### ðŸ§  AI-Powered Voice Detection
- **Silero VAD**: State-of-the-art neural network for voice activity detection
- **High Accuracy**: Better performance in noisy environments
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for live audio streams
- **Fallback Support**: Automatic fallback to RMS-based detection if needed

### ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz (optimized for Silero VAD)
- **Chunk Size**: 512 samples (32ms at 16kHz)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjustable (default: 0.5)
- **Processing Time**: ~1-2ms per chunk on modern hardware

## Files Modified

### `smart_mic.py`
- Added Silero VAD imports and initialization
- Implemented `load_vad_model()` function
- Enhanced `detect_voice_silero()` function with proper chunk handling
- Updated `record_with_vad()` to support both VAD methods
- Added UI controls for VAD method selection
- Updated configuration for optimal VAD performance

### `requirements.txt`
- Added `silero-vad==6.0.0`
- Added `torchaudio` for audio processing
- Updated dependencies for VAD support

## New Test Files

### `test_vad.py`
Basic functionality test for Silero VAD model loading and inference.

### `demo_vad.py`
Comprehensive demo showing VAD performance with different audio types and real-time simulation.

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install silero-vad torchaudio torch
```

### 2. Run the Smart Microphone
```bash
streamlit run smart_mic.py
```

### 3. Configure VAD Settings
- **VAD Method**: Choose between "Silero VAD (Recommended)" or "RMS-based (Fallback)"
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjust sensitivity (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Silence Duration**: Time before stopping recording
- **Min Recording Time**: Minimum recording duration

### 4. Test VAD Performance
```bash
# Basic functionality test
python3 test_vad.py

# Comprehensive demo
python3 demo_vad.py
```

## Performance Comparison

| Method | Accuracy | Noise Resistance | CPU Usage | Memory |
|--------|----------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| RMS-based | Basic | Low | Very Low | Minimal |
| Silero VAD | High | Excellent | Low | ~50MB |

## Configuration Options

### VAD Thresholds
- **Conservative (0.3-0.4)**: More sensitive, may catch background noise
- **Balanced (0.5-0.6)**: Recommended for most use cases
- **Strict (0.7-0.8)**: Less sensitive, may miss quiet speech

### Audio Settings
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz (required for optimal VAD performance)
- **Chunk Size**: 512 samples (32ms latency)
- **Format**: 16-bit PCM

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Fails**
   - Ensure internet connection for first-time model download
   - Check PyTorch installation
   - Verify sufficient disk space (~50MB)

2. **Poor Detection Accuracy**
   - Adjust confidence threshold
   - Check microphone quality
   - Ensure proper sample rate (16kHz)

3. **High CPU Usage**
   - Consider using GPU acceleration if available
   - Reduce chunk processing frequency
   - Use RMS fallback for low-power devices

### Fallback Behavior
If Silero VAD fails to load or encounters errors:
- Automatic fallback to RMS-based detection
- Warning message displayed to user
- Seamless operation continues

## Benefits of Silero VAD

1. **Better Accuracy**: Significantly improved voice detection in noisy environments
2. **Language Agnostic**: Works across different languages and accents
3. **Robust Performance**: Handles various audio conditions and qualities
4. **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for live audio applications
5. **Easy Integration**: Simple API with minimal configuration required
